# Easy images cropping tool v2.4.1

When building a training dataset, cropping a large number of images is a tedious task, and existing tools and tutorials often have complex operations, and the accuracy of automated AI tools is not satisfactory. Therefore, I developed a semi-automatic image batch cropping tool.

This tool can efficiently batch process image cropping tasks, and users can achieve fast and fine-tuning continuous cropping by manually drawing sanctions or setting specific aspect ratios.

For images that are too large or too small in size, users can flexibly adjust them by setting the aspect ratio.

For oversized images, users can also move and select the cropping area by dragging the slider.

The software has multiple pre-processing options for flipping and rotating, and provides a cropping preview function to ensure that the cropping effect meets expectations.

After each cropping, the cropping box will be retained and users can easily move it by right clicking and dragging, which is particularly convenient for quick and same size cropping of different focal points in consecutive images.

Overall, this software achieves a "WYSIWYG" fast image cropping experience.
